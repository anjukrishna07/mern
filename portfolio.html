   <h3>INTRO</h3>
   <p style="background-image: url(bird.jpg);">Hello! My name Sreelakshmi, and I am a recent graduate with a Master of Computer Applications (MCA) degree from KTU. With a strong foundation in software development, database management, and web technologies, I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems.
    
    During my studies, I gained hands-on experience in programming languages such as Java, Python, and C++, and developed skills in frameworks like React and Django. My projects is Driver drowsiness detection using deep learning, where I had the opportunity to enhance my problem-solving abilities and collaborate with diverse teams.
    
    I am particularly interested in  web development, data science, AI, etc., and I am eager to apply my knowledge in a dynamic work environment. My goal is to contribute to innovative projects that make a positive impact while continuously learning and growing in my field.
    
    Thank you for visiting my portfolio! I look forward to connecting and exploring opportunities where I can make a difference.</p>
    <h3>PROJECT</h3>
    <h4><B>DRIVER DROWSINESS DETECTION USING DEEP LEARNING</B></h4>
    <p>The Driver Drowsiness Detection project utilizes deep learning techniques to enhance road safety by monitoring drivers for signs of fatigue. By employing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on a diverse dataset of images depicting alert and drowsy drivers, the system analyzes real-time video feeds from a webcam to detect drowsiness. Utilizing technologies such as TensorFlow, OpenCV, and Python, the model achieves high accuracy in identifying fatigue, triggering visual and auditory alerts to prevent potential accidents. This project not only highlights the effectiveness of deep learning in real-world applications but also emphasizes the importance of addressing driver fatigue to improve overall safety on the roads.</p>
    <h4><B>AI BASED ADVOCHAT</B></h4>
    <P>The AI-Based AdvoChat project aims to revolutionize legal assistance by leveraging artificial intelligence to provide instant, accurate, and accessible legal advice through a chatbot interface. Designed for users seeking legal information, the chatbot utilizes natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to understand user queries and deliver relevant legal responses. By training the model on a diverse dataset of legal documents, case studies, and FAQs, AdvoChat is capable of addressing common legal concerns, guiding users through basic legal processes, and offering information about rights and responsibilities. The system integrates seamlessly with web and mobile platforms, ensuring 24/7 availability and a user-friendly experience. This project not only enhances access to legal information but also aims to reduce the burden on legal professionals, making legal advice more accessible to the general public. Future enhancements may include multilingual support and the incorporation of real-time legal updates.</P>
