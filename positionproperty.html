        <p> A programming language used primarily for creating interactive and dynamic web content.</p>
        <p>One of the three main technologies of the web, alongside HTML and CSS.</p> 
        <p>Allows real-time updates to web page elements without reloading the page.</p> 
        <p>Responds to user actions (e.g., clicks, form submissions) through event listeners.</p> 
        <p>Supports callbacks, promises, and async/await for non-blocking operations.</p>
        <p>Underpins popular frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js for efficient web app development.</p> 
        <p> Utilized on the server with Node.js, enabling JavaScript for full-stack development.</p>
        <p>Used for mobile apps (React Native), desktop apps, and game development.</p> 
        <p>Rich ecosystem with numerous libraries and tools, fostering continuous growth and community support.</p>
