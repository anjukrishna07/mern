            <p style="color: blue;">CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a powerful stylesheet language designed to enhance the presentation and layout of web pages written in HTML and XHTML. By separating content from design, CSS allows developers to apply various styles to multiple pages simultaneously, promoting consistency across a website. CSS operates on a hierarchical structure, with rules that include selectors, properties, and values. Selectors identify the HTML elements to be styled, while properties determine which aspects of the elements will be modified—such as color, font size, and spacing—and values define the specific style to apply.

                One of the key advantages of CSS is its ability to create responsive designs using media queries, which enable styles to change based on the screen size or device type. This ensures that websites look good and function well on both desktops and mobile devices. Additionally, CSS supports a variety of layout techniques, including Flexbox and CSS Grid, which facilitate complex layouts and allow for better control over the arrangement of elements on a page.</p>

        <p style="color:darkmagenta;">JavaScript is a versatile and widely-used programming language primarily known for its role in enhancing interactivity and functionality on websites. As a core technology of the web, alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript allows developers to create dynamic content that responds to user actions, making websites more engaging and interactive. It can manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), enabling real-time updates to web page elements without the need to reload the entire page.

            One of JavaScript's key features is its ability to handle events, such as clicks, form submissions, and keyboard inputs, allowing for responsive user interfaces. This is often achieved through event listeners, which execute specified functions when a particular event occurs. Additionally, JavaScript supports asynchronous programming through techniques such as callbacks, promises, and async/await, enabling developers to perform tasks like fetching data from servers without blocking the user interface.
            
            JavaScript is also the backbone of many popular frameworks and libraries, such as React, Angular, and Vue.js, which streamline the development of complex web applications by providing pre-built components and efficient data handling. Beyond the browser, JavaScript has gained popularity on the server side with Node.js, allowing developers to use a single language across the entire application stack.
            
            Moreover, JavaScript's flexibility allows for a wide range of applications beyond web development, including mobile app development (using frameworks like React Native), desktop applications, and even game development. With a rich ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community support, JavaScript continues to evolve, making it an essential skill for modern developers aiming to create responsive, interactive, and high-performance web applications.</p>
